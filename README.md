### **SELF GOALS FOR ASSIGNMENT:**

2.  Make app scalable (ability to add more questions or answers), can select the amount of questions per round and the time allotted per question by changing single variables "howManyQuestions" and "timeToAnswer" respectively
3.  Work with dynamically generated elements (Each button element is dynamically generated via JS), additionally each play button on the end screen is customized based on what score the user gets
4.  Replay value: Give user metrics on how they did, randomize questions from a large pool, randomize order of answers (no two rounds will ever likely be the same)
